# Ultraman: Single Image 3D Human Reconstruction with Ultra Speed and Detail

The author has been busy with his undergraduate graduation recently, and code organization has been slightly delayed.
But the code is expected to be released by April 23th. 
If you are interested you can also see our concurrent work [Idea-2-3D](https://air-discover.github.io/Idea-2-3D/) :)
